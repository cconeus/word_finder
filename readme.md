# Count a Word!

##### An application which counts instances of a certain word in a string, Version Date: 14 August 2015

#### By Dana Sharman

## Description

This application has two form inputs on the home page. One will gather the text which the user wishes to search for a certain word, and the second input allows the user to search for a certain word within the above text. When ran, it will take the user to a second page which displays the number of instances of the word, as well as the word itself in an easy to read format. This application would be great for counting the number of times a certain word appears in a given body of text. For example, if "Cat in the Hat" were to be input into the first box, and the word "Cat" were input into the second area, the second page will display "There appears to be ____ instances of the word "" in your text." where ___ is the number of instances, and "" is the word searched for.

## Setup

You will need to run a php server in order to view this if it is being run through your local machine.

## Technologies Used
