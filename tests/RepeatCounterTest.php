// for some reason strtoupper doesnt seem to want to work, either in this test or in the actual code. I've tried strtoupper, strtolower, mb_strtoupper, using explode and implode to break the string apart and upper/lowercase it, it still will not find a match. If I create the explode/implode method over on the RepeatCounter.php file, it will pass this test, but then fail the first test of attempting to find a match of 1 for CAT. This tells me that it IS converting it to uppercase, as this second test passes, however for some reason I cant figure out, will cause test 1 to no longer find a match. Running short on time at this point, so I'm going to begin making my Silex app to build the project.

            $test_RepeatCounter = new RepeatCounter;
            $search_string = strtoupper("The cat in the hat");
            $input = strtoupper("cAt");

            $result = $test_RepeatCounter->countRepeats($search_string, $input);


            $this->assertEquals("CAT", $result);
        }
